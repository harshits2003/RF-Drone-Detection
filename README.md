This project simulates RF activity-based drone detection.
RF signals are abstracted as activity patterns over time.
Feature extraction is performed using statistical measures.
Detection logic is validated in simulation before hardware integration.
Next step: ESP32-based alert system.


The work would be done in sessions, as listed below:

Session 1: RF Activity Simulation

Session 2: Feature space visualization

Session 3: Threshold calibration and visible decision boundary (Designing the Detector)

Session 4: Embedded Mapping (PC -> ESP32 logic)

Session 5: Hardware abstraction layer
